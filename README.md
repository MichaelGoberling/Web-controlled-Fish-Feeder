# Web-controlled-Fish-Feeder

This repository is for a project I completed with Riley Hester in ECEN 4910. That project was an automated fish feeder that could
be controlled via a very simple web application. The hardware used for this project was a BeagleBone Black with a Debian Linux
flavor operating system. The project takes advantage of the Adafruit Python pin control library to control a PWM pin on the 
BBB. 

The report can be found in this same repository. The report outlines at a high level what the project does.
